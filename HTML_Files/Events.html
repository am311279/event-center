            Sleep Token wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy
            tickets at face value. To make this possible, they have chosen to
            use Ticketmaster's Face Value Exchange. If fans purchase tickets for
            a show and can't attend, they'll have the option to resell them to
            other fans on Ticketmaster at the original price paid. Please note,
            a valid bank account or debit card within the country of your event
            is required to sell on Ticketmaster.
