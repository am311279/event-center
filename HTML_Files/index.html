        <h3>About Ball Arena</h3>
        <p>
          Privately owned and operated, groundbreaking for the arena took place
          on November 20, 1997. Since opening as the Pepsi Center on October 1,
          1999 with a sold-out performance by Celine Dion, the arena has hosted
          a wide variety of events including hockey and basketball games,
          musical acts, and family events. In 2020, Ball Corporation acquired
          the naming rights and renamed the venue Ball Arena.Designed by HOK
          Sports Facilities Group of Kansas City, Ball Arena occupies a 4.6-acre
          footprint in Denver’s Central Platte Valley. With more than 675, 000
          square feet of building space, the five-level facility is a premier
          sports and entertainment destination. Home of the NBA’s Denver
          Nuggets, NHL’s Colorado Avalanche, and NLL’s Colorado Mammoth, Ball
          Arena seats 19,099 for basketball games and 18,007 for hockey and
          lacrosse games. Depending on stage configuration, the venue seats up
          to 20,000 for concerts and other events. Ball Arena features 89 luxury
          suites located on two levels and 1,900 club seats, as well as two
          Theatre Boxes to deliver an exciting fan experience with first-class
          amenities such as VIP parking, gourmet catering, and access to the
          exclusive PointsBet Club Level.Ball Arena is one of the very few
          sports venues in North America that provides a separate practice
          facility for its team within the building. The Denver Nuggets practice
          court is a full-size basketball court utilized by the team for all its
          practice sessions. Additional features of Ball Arena include a
          cutting-edge sound JBL Vertec line array sound system to cover the
          spectator seating bowl; and a 70,000 lbs Daktronics-manufactured
          center-hung scoreboard that rivals the largest of its kind in the
          world. A new state-of-the-art projection system transforms the Ball
          Arena floor into a giant 4K resolution screen during team events and
          is a must-see feature. The arena also has Wi-Fi access throughout the
          building.
